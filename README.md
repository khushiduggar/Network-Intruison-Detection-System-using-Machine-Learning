# Network-Intruison-Detection-System-using-Machine-Learning
Developed a system to detect network intrusions using various machine learning models (Decision Trees, KNN, Logistic Regression, Random Forest), achieving an intrusion detection accuracy of 92%.
Utilized XGBoost for gradient boosting, improving threat detection precision by 15% compared to traditional models.
Conducted extensive model evaluation, with precision and recall scores exceeding 90%, using confusion matrix and classification reports for model validation.
Analyzed over 100,000 network traffic records, identifying malicious activities with a false-positive rate of less than 5%.
Visualized model performance and network threats using Seaborn and Matplotlib, reducing data interpretation time by 20% through clear graphical representation.
